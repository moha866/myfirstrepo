Tutorial
========

This is my first GitHub repository to start learning. Don't forget to press the 'i' button to start writing, and 'esc' to get out of the insert mode. To exit without saving ':q' and to save and quit ':x'.
git commands:
git init: create a new repository
git status: changed files in directory
git add .: add curent changes to the next commit
git commit: commit previous staged changes
git log: show all commits starting with newest
git blame: who changed what and when
git branch -av: list all existing branches
